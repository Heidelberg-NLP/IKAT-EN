e1: The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade.				STATE	individual assignments, cumulative grade (PartOf)/individual assignments, bachelor degree (PartOf)/individual assignments, final grade (PartOf)/bachelor degree, cumulative grade (IsA)/bachelor degree, final grade (IsA)/bachelor degree, individual assignemnts (HasA)/grade, cumulative (HasProperty)/final grade, cumulative (HasProperty)/bachelor degree, cumulative (HasProperty)/bachelor degree, individual assignments (MadeOf)/cumulative grade, individual assignments (MadeOf)/final grade, individual assignments (MadeOf)/bachelor degree, individual assignment (HasSubevent)															
e2: This is also more akin to the real working world later, where performance isn't singular, but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods.				STATE/GENERIC/GENERIC	cumulative grade, akin to the real working world later (HasProperty)/performance, delivered over longer periods (ReceivesAction)/real world performance, constant (HasProperty)/real world performance, delivered over longer periods of time (HasProperty)/real world, performance (HasPrerequisite)															
e3: That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits).				STATE/GENERIC	bachelor thesis, final grade (PartOf)/bachelor thesis, small (HasProperty)/bachelor thesis, small portion of final grade (IsA)/final grade, bachelor thesis (HasLastSubevent)/final grade, bachelor thesis (HasSubevent)

GENERIC	effort, required of the individual (HasProperty)/modules, equally weighted (HasProperty)/effort, differ strongly (CapableOf)/effort for modules, different (HasProperty)/modules, effort (HasPrerequisite)/modules, effort (HasPrerequisite)/modules, weighted equally (ReceivesAction)															
e5: It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.				STATE	final thesis, effort (HasPrerequisite)/effort, adjusted (ReceivesAction)/effort, wise (HasProperty)
